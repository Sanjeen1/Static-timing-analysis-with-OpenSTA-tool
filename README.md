# Static-timing-analysis-with-OpenSTA-tool
A complete workflow for performing static timing analysis using the open-source OpenSTA tool on a synthesized digital design. Includes constraint setup (.sdc), open source library file sky130/nangate45 (.lib), Synthesized Verilog file (.v)  and generation of detailed timing reports for setup and hold analysis. Slack calculation. 

**Key features of tool- **
---> Static Timing Analysis for setup and hold checks

**Reads industry-standard formats:**
--->Liberty (.lib) cell libraries.
--->Verilog netlists (.v).
--->Synopsys Design Constraints (.sdc).
--->Standard Parasitic Exchange Format (.spef).
Reports critical paths, slack values, and timing violations.
Scriptable via Tcl commands for automation.
Works in both pre-layout and post-layout analysis stages.

📌 How to Use OpenSTA
This section walks through running Static Timing Analysis on your design using OpenSTA.
1️⃣ Prepare Your Files
You’ll need:
--->_Cell library_ – .lib file for your technology
--->_Synthesized netlist_ – .v file generated by Yosys or other synthesis tools
--->_Constraints file _– .sdc defining clock period, input/output delays, etc.
--->_(Optional) Parasitics file_ – .spef for post-layout timing analysis

This repository contains a complete flow for performing Static Timing Analysis (STA) on a synthesized digital design using the open-source OpenSTA tool. 
By following this flow, you can reproduce the static timing analysis of the provided design, verify timing correctness, and gain insights into the timing performance and bottlenecks of your digital circuits using an open-source toolchain.
