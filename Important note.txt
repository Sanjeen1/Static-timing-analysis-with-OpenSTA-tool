To write the SDC constraint file best book is - Static Timing Analysis for Nanometer Designs A Practical Approach by J. Bhasker â€¢ Rakesh Chadha

There are many constraints, here is few of them in SDC file

opensta comes with openroad tool

give command sta to start 

read_liberty nangate45_slow.lib  \\read liberty file
read_verilog sta_netlist.v 	\\ read synthesized verilog file
link_design sta_1		\\read sta_1 module
read_sdc SDC.sdc       		\\read sdc file
report_checks			\\give timing report
